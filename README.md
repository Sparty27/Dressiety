## About me

I'm Nazar Nyshchyi (20 years old), i'm a developer from Kivertsi, Volyn Oblast, Ukraine. After studying C# for a year, I worked on a team project at MINT, where I honed my programming skills. In the winter of 2024, I began exploring PHP and the Laravel framework, driven by a growing interest in web development.
